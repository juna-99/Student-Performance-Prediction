# Student Performance Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict student performance based on various factors using machine learning models. The goal is to identify students at risk of poor academic performance and provide early interventions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Modeling:** Implementation of multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation:** Comparison of models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment:** Model deployment using a web-based interface (if applicable).

## Dataset
The dataset used includes various features such as demographics, social background, and academic information. It is preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical data.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
